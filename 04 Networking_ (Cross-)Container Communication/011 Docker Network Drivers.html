Only works in "Swarm" mode which is a dated /&nbsp;almost deprecated way of connecting multiple containers</p></li><li><p><strong>macvlan</strong>: You can set a custom MAC&nbsp;address to a container - this address can then be used for communication with that container</p></li><li><p><strong>none</strong>: All networking is disabled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Third-party plugins</strong>:&nbsp;You can install third-party plugins which then may add all kinds of behaviors and functionalities</p></li></ul><p>As mentioned, the "<strong>bridge</strong>"&nbsp;driver makes most sense in the vast majority of scenarios.</p></p>
